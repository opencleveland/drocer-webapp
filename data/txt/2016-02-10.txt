ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 93-16.
By Council Members Reed, J. Johnson, Conwell, Zone, Kazy, and Brady.
An emergency resolution calling
upon Congress to pass, and President
Obama to sign, H.R. 2612/S.1473, in
relation to congressional funding for
gun violence research.
Whereas, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there were 51,377 incidents of gun violence in the United
States in 2014, resulting in 12,518
deaths and 22,886 injuries; and
Whereas, gun violence has once
again become the focus of national
attention, with mass shootings in San
Bernardino, at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon, and at an historic black church in Charleston,
South Carolina; and
Whereas, according to Mother
Jones’ A Guide to Mass Shootings in
America, there have been at least 73
mass shootings in this country since

February 10, 2016
1982, defined as an incident that
killed at least four people in a public
place; and
Whereas, while mass shootings
tend to dominate media coverage,
there are gun violence injuries occurring every day in many American
cities, including Cleveland, Ohio; and
Whereas, the national debate on
gun violence has been contentious for
decades; and
Whereas, in 1996, Congress passed
an amendment to restrict federal
funding for gun violence research;
and
dubbed
the
Dickey
Whereas,
Amendment after its author, former
U.S. Representative Jay Dickey, it
remains in effect today and prohibits
funding for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (“CDC”) to be
used “to advocate or promote gun control”; and
Whereas, although the language of
the amendment allows funding for
research not aimed at advocacy for
gun control, in effect it has been interpreted such that no research related
to gun violence is funded through the
CDC; and
Whereas, in recent years former
Representative Dickey has publicly
expressed his regrets for having
authored this amendment; and
Whereas, in a December 1, 2015 letter to U.S. Representative Mike
Thompson, Chair of the House Gun
Violence Prevention Task Force, Representative
Dickey
stated
that
‘research could have been continued
on gun violence without infringing on
the rights of gun owners, in the same
fashion that the highway industry
continued its research on how to
reduce head-on collisions on highways without eliminating the automobile”; and
Whereas, Representative Dickey
also stated in the letter that “scientific research should help answer how
we can best reduce gun violence…
[doing] nothing is no longer an
acceptable solution”; and
Whereas, momentum is building to
restore funding to the CDC for gun
violence research; and
Whereas, in 2012 in the aftermath of
the shooting at an elementary school
in Newtown, Connecticut, President
Obama instructed the CDC to strictly
interpret the Dickey Amendment so
that the restriction is on advocacy,
not research; and
Whereas, in June 2015, U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney and U. S.
Senator Edward Markey introduced
H.R. 2612/S. 1473 to authorize the
appropriation of at least $10 million a
year to the CDC for conducting or supporting research on firearms safety
or gun violence prevention; and
Whereas, in October 2015, addressing the nation after the mass shooting
at Umpqua Community College in
Oregon, President Obama said, “We
spent over a trillion dollars and
passed countless laws and devote
entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully
so. And yet we have a Congress who
explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially
reduce gun deaths”; and
Whereas, in November 2015, dozens
of lawmakers in the U.S. House of
Representatives signed a letter urging leaders of the Appropriations
Committee to repeal the Dickey
Amendment; and
Whereas, in early December 2015,
o ver 2 ,00 0 ph ysician s from nin e

The City Record

19

medical associations publicly urged
C ongres s to repeal the Dic key
Amendment, citing gun violence as a
public health crisis;
Whereas, in Cleveland, the year
2015 was one of the most violent years
in decades, with homicides up 15%
and felonious assaults with a firearm
up more than 30% over 2014; and
Whereas, also in 2015, Cleveland
tragically saw the killing of two toddlers and an infant in separate incidents of errant gunfire; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon Congress to pass, and President
Obama to sign, H.R. 2612/S.1473, in
relation to congressional funding for
gun violence research.

shall take effect and be in force from

Effective February 2, 2016.

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
