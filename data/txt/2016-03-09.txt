ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 186-16.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution declaring
the month of March 2016 as National
Social Work Month, recognizing the
numerous contributions made by
America’s social workers, and calling
upon all citizens to join with the
National Association of Social Workers in celebration and support of the
social work profession.
Whereas, the primary mission of
the social work profession is to
enhance well-being and help meet the
basic needs of all people, especially
the most vulnerable in society; and
Whereas, social work is one of the
fastest growing careers in the United
States with more than 640,000 members of the profession; and
Whereas, with over 24,000 licensed
social workers in Ohio, their help
reaches every part of the community
at every stage of life; and

22
Whereas, social workers work in
all areas of our society to improve
happiness, health and prosperity,
including in government, schools, universities, social service agencies,
communities, the military and mental
health and health care facilities; and
Whereas, social workers daily
embody this year’s Social Work
Month theme, “Forging Solutions Out
of Challenges,” by helping individuals, communities and the larger society tackle and solve issues that confront them; and
Whereas, social workers have
helped this nation live up to its ideals
by successfully pushing for equal
rights for all, including women,
African Americans, Latinos, people
who are LGBTQ and various ethnic,
cultural and religious groups; and
Whereas, social workers have
helped people in this nation overcome
racial strife and economic and health
care uncertainty by successfully
advocating for initiatives such as
Medicaid, unemployment insurance,
workplace safety, Social Security benefits, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting
Rights Act, and the Affordable Care
Act; and
Whereas, social workers are the
largest group of mental health care
providers in the United States and
work daily to help people overcome
depression, anxiety, substance abuse
and other disorders so they can lead
more fulfilling lives; and
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs employs more than
12,000 professional social workers
who help bolster our nation’s security
by providing support to active duty
military personnel, veterans and their
families; and
Whereas, thousands of child, family and school social workers across
the country provide assistance to protect children and improve the social
and psychological functioning of children and their families; and
Whereas, social workers help children find loving homes and create
new families through adoption; and
Whereas, social workers in schools
work with families and schools to foster future generations by ensuring
students reach their full academic
and personal potential; and
Whereas, social workers work with
older adults and their families to
improve their quality of life and ability to live independently as long as
possible and get access to quality
mental health and health care; and
Whereas, social workers have
helped the United States and other
nations
overcome
earthquakes,
floods, wars and other disasters by
helping survivors get services such as
food, shelter, and health care and
mental health care to address stress
and anxiety; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
this important profession and the critical role it plays in our Cleveland community, Ohio, and the nation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

of the City as may be necessary,
such amounts of public money as
may be needed in the opinion of the
Director of Finance to transact the
daily business of the Treasury or
such offices.
(b) The City Treasurer shall
deposit in active deposits such
amounts of public monies as are needed in the opinion of the Director of
Finance to provide the needed cash
flow to pay City warrants and checks
issued and outstanding, and a reasonable surplus in addition to the amount
needed to pay such warrants and
checks. All public monies of the City
not deposited in active deposits or
retained pursuant to division (a) of
this section shall be invested in accordance with Section 178.12 of this chapter.

or control with an eligible depository
on the business day next following
the day of receipt if the total amount

does not exceed one thousand dollars

347

($1,000.00), the monies shall be
